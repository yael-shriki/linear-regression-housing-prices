# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
## This project aims to predict house prices using linear regression. We will use a dataset containing housing prices in King County, USA. The dataset consists of 5,000 observations with 18 features and a single target value - the house price.


In this project, we will perform the following steps:

Load and preprocess the dataset.
Implement linear regression from scratch.
Train the model using gradient descent and efficient gradient descent algorithms.
Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics.
Perform feature selection and polynomial feature expansion to improve model accuracy.


Before running the code, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. The following libraries are required:
numpy
pandas
You can install them using pip:
pip install numpy pandas

Feel free to explore the Jupyter notebook to view the data visualizations for the linear regression. I've saved the notebook with the graphs after running the code!
